FLHook Discovery 3.0.0
=============

This is the public repository for Discovery Freelancer's FLHook.
The client hook and the server anticheat are not available due to their sensitivity.

The SVN data in the repository is linked to http://forge.the-starport.net/projects/flhookplugin
This will allow developers to easily merge new starport revisions with this project.

This project is configured to run under Visual Studio 2015. Everybody can contribute with the Community Edition.
The compiler is VC140. (surprise)

Our current starport revision is #267.

Please note there's some pretty bad code here and there. I didn't have time to refactor my old contributions as I became more skilled over time.
If you come across it and want to refactor it, you're very much welcome.
